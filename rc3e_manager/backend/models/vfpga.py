class VFpga(models.Model):
    """ The vFPGA class
    represents a users reservation of one or multiple consecutive region_types on an FPGA.
    These region_types must be consecutive and on the same FPGA. The region_types are abstracted into a virtual FPGA.
    The entries are retained after the end of the reservation period for accounting purposes.

    A vFPGA can have the following states:
        * PENDING - if the reservation was made but the accounting period has not started yet
        * ACTIVE - if the accounting period has started, but not yet ended
        * EXPIRED - if the accounting period is over

    NOTE: A vFPGA may only be programmed while in the ACTIVE state.

    Attribute by_user:
    A foreign key to the user who made the reservation and who is accountable for it.

    Attribute creation_date:
    The date on which the database entry was created. This does not mark the beginning of accountability.
    By default, the creation date will be set to django.utils.timezone.now

    Attribute reservation_start_date:
    The date upon which the reservation period begins. This does mark the begin of accountability.

    Attribute reservation_end_date:
    The date upon which the reservation period ends. This does mark the end of accountability.
